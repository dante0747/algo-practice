## What is algo-practice?
This repository intends to provide a set of practical examples and implementations of data structures and algorithms in 
which people usually have troubles in understanding. 

## Who are the audiences?
These examples could be a proper resource for those computer science students who need to obtain a deep understanding 
of data structures and also programmers who intend to pass their upcoming or coding interviews.

## Structure
This repository consists of two sections: implementations and exercises. In the first section, you can find the 
implementation of the widely used data structures such as **Arrays**, **Linked Lists**, **Trees**, **Stacks**, **Queues**, etc. The second 
part contains several samples and interview questions from different sources. For each example, there is at least one 
solution and some unit tests that cover the edge cases.

BTW, any contribution to make the solutions efficient and optimized is very welcome ðŸ˜‰

## Programming Language
**Java 11** ðŸ˜Ž
