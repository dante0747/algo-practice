## Excercise #4 - Reverse the queue

Implement a method that reverses the input (or encapsulated) queue. Note that, you're only allowed to use the **add**, 
**remove**, and **isEmpty** methods of **java.util.Queue**.

#### Sample:
input queue: [15, -6, 9, 1, 5, 2, 0, -1, 8]

reversed queue: [8, -1, 0, 2, 5, 1, 9, -6, 15]
